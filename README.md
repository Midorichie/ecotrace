# EcoTrace: Blockchain-Powered Supply Chain Transparency

## Overview
EcoTrace is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Stacks blockchain that enables end-to-end tracking of sustainable products throughout their supply chain journey. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency, traceability, and verification of ethical sourcing practices while reducing environmental impact.

## Features
- Product origin tracking and verification
- Real-time supply chain monitoring
- Ethical sourcing certification
- Carbon footprint tracking
- Consumer-facing product history interface

## Technical Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity (Stacks blockchain)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Blockchain Indexer**: Rust
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Smart Contracts
1. **ProductRegistry.clar**: Manages product registration and updates
2. **SupplyChainVerification.clar**: Handles verification of supply chain steps
3. **CarbonFootprint.clar**: Tracks and calculates product carbon footprint

## Getting Started
